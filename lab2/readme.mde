### Executive Summary
IT 1025 will show you many explantians of hardware and how its used. It will also show you data representation and how it is made and used in this course

### Hardware
#### Hardware And Memory
Disk rpm is a critical component beacuse it can impact the latency and the disk transfer rate. The more data that passes under the magnetic head the slower the rpms are.
Which eqauls more mechanical latencies. Mechanical latencies is measured in milliseconds and include seek time and rotational latencies. The transfer rate is the speed at which date is transferred to and from the disk media.
It's mostly descibed as megabytes per second.
